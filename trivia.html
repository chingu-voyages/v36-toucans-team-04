                Christopher Sholes designed the QWERTY keyboard we use today in 1872. This design has been used for 150 years.
                Ironically, this is not the most efficient keyboard layout.

                Developed in 1936 by an American psychologist, the Dvorak layout was designed to minimize finger
                movements to cause less strain and fewer errors. Unfortunately, by this time, the QWERTY design
                has already been widespread.
